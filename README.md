# Earth Core Robot

[Design Specifications](./design.md)

In the year 2142, humanity's insatiable curiosity looked inwards. Project Icarus, a colossal undertaking aiming to delve into the Earth's heart, neared completion. At its core, quite literally, lay BR-723, a technological marvel – a robot crafted from Tantalum Hafnium Carbide, an alloy impervious to the unimaginable pressures and searing heat of the mantle.

BR-723, better known as "Coreseeker," was more than just bolts and wires. It housed a sophisticated AI, capable of independent analysis and decision-making. In fact, if something went wrong, like a part breaking, it had sensors to detect it, 3d print new parts, and swap it out really quick. As launch day arrived, the world watched anxiously as Coreseeker, encased in its diamond-tipped drill, began its descent into the Mariana Trench, the deepest scar on the planet's face.

The descent was agonizingly slow. Every meter conquered was a testament to Coreseeker's resilience. Weeks bled into months as the robot burrowed deeper, the pressure gauge a constant reminder of the immense weight of the world above. The pre-programmed course for the descent unfolded like this:

* Layer: Crust
  * Distance to Travel Through Layer: 30 km
  * Target Speed Within Layer: 10 km/hr
  * Estimated Time to Travel Through Layer: 3 hours
* Layer: Mantle
  * Distance to Travel Through Layer: 2,900 km
  * Target Speed Within Layer: 20 km/hr
  * Estimated Time to Travele Through Layer: 145 hours
* Layer: Lithosphere (crust and upper mantle)
  * Distance to Travel Through Layer: 100 km
  * Target Speed Within Layer: 10 km/hr
  * Estimated Time to Travel Through Layer: 10 hours
* Layer: Asthenosphere (within mantle)
  * Distance to Travel Through Layer: 2,800 km
  * Target Speed Within Layer: 20 km/hr
  * Estimated Time to Travel Through Layer: 140 hours
* Layer: Outer Core
  * Distance to Travel Through Layer: 2,200 km
  * Target Speed Within Layer: 50 km/hr
  * Estimated Time to Travel Through Layer: 44 hours
* Layer: Inner Core
  * Distance to Travel Through Layer: 1,200 km
  * Target Speed Within Layer: 30 km/hr
  * Estimated Time to Travel Through Layer: 40 hours

Finally, Coreseeker reached the boundary between the mantle and the core, a churning sea of molten metal. The temperature soared beyond imagination, threatening to melt even Coreseeker's advanced shell. But the robot, guided by its agile AI, activated its internal cooling system, a testament to human ingenuity. It then unleashed its high-powered laser, carving a path through the dense liquid metal.

As Coreseeker ventured deeper, it encountered a landscape defying human comprehension. Crystal formations, unlike anything seen on the surface, protruded from the core's walls, pulsating with an inner light unlike anything witnessed before. The robot carefully extended a manipulator arm, collecting samples for later analysis.

Days turned into weeks as Coreseeker explored this alien realm, sending back invaluable data. It discovered evidence of primordial lifeforms, their fossilized remains trapped within the metallic embrace of the Earth. These discoveries hinted at a genesis far grander and more mysterious than humanity ever imagined.

But as Coreseeker ventured deeper, its primary power source, the nuclear reactor, began to sputter. The robot, its mission incomplete, was forced to turn back. The ascent was a grueling battle against the immense pressure, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of its environment. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Coreseeker breached the surface, greeted by the euphoric cheers of a jubilant humanity.

Coreseeker's mission had opened a new chapter in human history, forever altering our perception of the world beneath our feet. The robot, forever marked by its fiery journey, stood as a testament to human ingenuity and our unwavering quest to unravel the universe's greatest mysteries.

However, the journey was far from over. The collected data unleashed a torrent of questions. Were the fossilized lifeforms remnants of a primordial ecosystem? Did the pulsating crystals hold the key to harnessing unimagined energy sources? Coreseeker, forever etched with the scars of its fiery descent, became more than just a robot – it became a symbol of humanity's first steps towards unlocking the Earth's deepest secrets. As scientists toiled over the data, a new generation of robots, inspired by Coreseeker's success, were already being designed. The journey to the Earth's core, once a fantastical dream, had become the first step on a path towards a future filled with both awe and trepidation.
